The code in this project is the basis of the Wicket/activit-article in the German Java Magazin.

This project is aimed to provide a full integration of Wicket (wicket.apache.org) with Activiti (ww.activiti.org).
It is currently working but not yet in the state to be considered a full library.
Missing items:
- Extract components into a separate library
- add unit tests (while moving stuff from another project I broke them, will be added soon)

To try it out:
This is a Maven-Project with no IDE-dependencies. Just check it out into your favorit IDE and build it.
Run de.codepitbull.Start from the tests-Folder and you are good to go.
